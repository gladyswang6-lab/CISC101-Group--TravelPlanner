Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)**

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants (vegetarian only), parks).Each activity includes type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

for each day:    pick Morning activity (near lodging)    pick Midday activity (close by)    pick Afternoon activity (different theme)    pick Evening restaurant (vegetarian only) or optional event
